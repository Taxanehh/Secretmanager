# Goal for the day

Today, I want to create a full front-end for my secretmanager. Working by a "make-everything-before-the-login-phase" logic, I also hope to create atleast a register function and maybe a login function too if I have time.

# Topics covered

- Learned how to use Figma, quickly made a mockup for my website idea
- Made a quick and neat main page, contact page and about page
- Made a for now nice register page with some register requirements / instructions
- Began making app.py and adding some routes and a register function.
- Made a small start for the dashboard
