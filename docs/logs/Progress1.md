# Goal for the day

Today, I wish to make a start at creating my own portfolio website, all the while following the heap of git issues we've been given by our tutors. Using simple progress logs in this folder, I wish to keep track of my progress which will eventually lead to making a working secretmanager.

- Start making plan for portfolio website
- Cover some issues in git
- Figure out a neat way of tracking my personal progress and reflections

# Requirements

- For today, a working brain that's focussed on UI Design (which is quite a flaw of mine, I might end up not using Figma or anything else at all)
- Creating a progress folder
- Refreshing my knowledge on webdesign and webcreation

# Topics covered

- I've used an old, depricated version of my brothers website to base my design off. The website needs a really, really lot of work to be fully functional and is missing a lot of library and dependency updates.
- I've also made a simple HTML and CSS based website to cover the initial assignment.
- Tomorrow i will work on the Github issues

# Personal notes

- It's really important to frequently commit changes
- It's also really important to keep your software and everything else really updated to avoid huge code rewrites and overhauls that you keep saying "I'll do that later" to
