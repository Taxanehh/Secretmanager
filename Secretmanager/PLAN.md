- Main page (index.html)
- Navigation bar
- 1 css file
- Registration page
- Registration instructions
- Login page
- Responsive design (so I don't have to rewrite anything / everything later)
- Registration to .CSV file
- Secrets page
- Recording secrets
- Showing secrets
- Unaccessable secrets page
- Logging out
- Changing secrets
- Deleting secrets
- Scrolling secrets
- Loginpage validation
- Selecting secrets
- 2FA
- HTTPS
- PEN test & SQL test
- Website documentation
