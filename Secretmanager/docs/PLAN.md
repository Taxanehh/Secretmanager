## Time plan

Since every coder ever is writing their projects in English, I decided to write my documents and comments in English too.

# SIDENOTE

I have worked on this project in my own personal GitHub up until a certain point (up to a barely alpha version)
By this logic, It will seem as if I have quickly copied the .css code, but in reality I am currently structuring this project and uploading it to HvA Gitlab
in pieces with what I have built up until now.

# The plan

- ✓ Main page (index.html)
- ✓ Make a wireframe, combine that in the wireflow and code the part
- ✓ Navigation bar
- ✓ 1 css file
- ✓ Registration page
- ✓ Registration instructions
- ✓ Login page
- ✓ Responsive design (so I don't have to rewrite anything / everything later)
- ✓ Registration to .CSV file
- ✓ Secrets page
- ✓ Recording secrets
- ✓ Showing secrets
- ✓ Unaccessable secrets page
- ✓ Logging out
- ✓ Changing secrets
- ✓ Deleting secrets
- ✓ Scrolling secrets
- ✓ Loginpage validation
- ✓ 2FA
- ✓ HTTPS
- ✓ PEN test
- ✓ Website documentation
