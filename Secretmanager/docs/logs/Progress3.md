# Goal for the day

I hope to fully finish the dashboard today

# Topics covered

- Put all dashboard requirements in a mental note (fancy way of saying i try to remember everything)
- Seems like i keep switching between my user.email for school and for my personal github, shouldn't be a problem though
- Further upgraded app.py with more routs and functions, like for the login page
- Finally, created an alpha version of the Secretmanager
