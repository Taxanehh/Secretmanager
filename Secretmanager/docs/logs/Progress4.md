# Goal for the day

Time to scrap old, unused code and comments. It seems I tend to forget to delete some functions that are of no use
I also found out the dashboard secrets need some requirements like filter systems

# Topics covered

- Lazy day today, made a small start at login times
- Most of my time went to some dumb log in issue, where i did a typo so I couldn't log in
- Covered some dashboard requirements
