# Goal for the day

Time to make 2FA! Maybe cover some more issues if 2FA is easy, but don't know as of yet

# Topics covered

- 2FA was actually quite easy when I found a lot of imports that work together
- Nginx was the easiest of everything: it seems I fixed that rather quick
- Found out there were code conventions, so i checked my code again to make sure i abide by these conventions.
